For the story problem maker
* Add %HINT
* Add %PL for direct perl (not going up front as %SETUP)
* Add a simple randomized versioning so that we can have some 
  randomness in the multiple choice.  Something like (though that requires
  two passes)
    %RANDOMVERS
      foo
    %NEXTVER
      foo
    %NEXTVER
      foo
    %ENDVER
* Seems like including just a "$a" or some such as radio option doesn't seem to
  work.  Debug.
