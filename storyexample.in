This is an example story proof thingie
with interspersed questions.  Here's some math \(\int_0^1 f(x)\,dx .\)

That was a paragraph break (leave empty line).  The rest of the syntax is
like regular WeBWorK syntax (i.e. not PGML).  Normal text just gets
copied verbatim into the problem file.

If you want to avoid giving hints after submit about which parts were correct,
put %NOPARTIALANSWERS at the beginning of a line (presumably first line is
good).  Proofs require draggableProof.pl to work (presumably from WeBWork 2.16
onwards this works automatically).

%PROOF
First statement
Second statement
Third statement
%EXTRA
Extra wrong statement
Another Extra wrong statement
%END

There are also radio buttons with only a linebreak;
%BR
%RADIO
Wrong 1 (some math \(x^2\))
Wrong 2
%CORRECT Correct
Wrong 3
%END

And another radio thing
%BR
%RADIO
True
%CORRECT False
%END

Here are radio buttons randomized except for the last option which always comes last.  And there's a whole paragraph break

%RADIO
%BEGINRANDOM
%CORRECT Choice A
Choice B
Choice C
%ENDRANDOM
None of these
%END

We can also have another proof surely, maybe without any wrong statements

%PROOF
Statement \(x \not= y\)
Another Statement
%END

And we can add a hint on the number of correct statements

%PROOFHINT
Statement \(x \not= y\)
Another Statement
%EXTRA
Wrong statement
%END
