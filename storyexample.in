This is an example story proof thingie with interspersed questions.  Here's
some math \(\int_0^1 f(x)\,dx .\)

That was a paragraph break (leave empty line).  The rest of the syntax is
like regular WeBWorK syntax (i.e. not PGML).  Normal text just gets
copied verbatim into the problem file.

If you want to avoid giving hints after submit about which parts were correct,
put %NOPARTIALANSWERS at the beginning of a line.  If you want to give all or
nothing rather than partial credit, put %NOPARTIALCREDIT at the beginning of a
line.  Presumably you'd use the first few lines of the file for these.
You can also just use %NOPARTIAL to turn on both of these, which is the most
common option

Proofs require draggableProof.pl to work (presumably from WeBWork 2.16
onwards this works automatically).

%PROOF
First statement
Second statement
Third statement
%EXTRA
Extra wrong statement
Another Extra wrong statement
%END

There are also radio buttons with only a linebreak;
%BR
%RADIO
Wrong 1 (some math \(x^2\))
Wrong 2
%CORRECT Correct
Wrong 3
%END

And another radio thing
%BR
%RADIO
True
%CORRECT False
%END

Here are radio buttons randomized except for the last option which always comes last.  And there's a whole paragraph break

%RADIO
%BEGINRANDOM
%CORRECT Choice A
Choice B
Choice C
%ENDRANDOM
None of these
%END

There is a short version of this:

%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT Choice A
Choice B
Choice C
%ENDRANDOM
None of these
%END

The %ENDRANDOM is added automatically if needed so if we want to just randomize everything we can write:

%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT Choice A
Choice B
Choice C
%END

The given first option is taken as the correct answer in case nothing is marked as correct, so the following
is the same as above, just a bit less readable.

%RADIORANDOM
Choice A
Choice B
Choice C
%END

We can also have another proof surely, maybe without any wrong statements

%PROOF
Statement \(x \not= y\)
Another Statement
%END

And we can add a hint on the number of correct statements

%PROOFHINT
Statement \(x \not= y\)
Another Statement
%EXTRA
Wrong statement
%END

If we want to have formulas, add %FORMULAVARS x,y on a separate line
where the list is a comma separated (no spaces) list of variable names
all formulas here will use.

%FORMULAVARS x,y,z

Then we ask a formula as follows.

How about a formula
%FORMULA x^2+y^2+z^2

We can also ask for a number:

How about a number
%NUMBER 42

We can randomize by adding some setup and using that.
Note that setup is always put at the top of the file!
It can really be kind of anything.
%SETUP $a=random(2,9,1);

What's 2 times \{$a\}?
%NUMBER 2*$a

Normally the answer rule width is 20 for numbers and 40 for formulas.  With
the %RULEWIDTH statement you can change it to another width (used for both
from then on.)  The next rule will be 80-wide.

%RULEWIDTH 80
%NUMBER 42

If you want to go back to the defaults just set rule width to 0.

%RULEWIDTH 0

Now the number field will be again 20-wide.

%NUMBER 42
