This is an example story proof thingie
with interspersed questions.  Here's some math \(\int_0^1 f(x)\,dx .\)

That was a paragraph break

%PROOF
First statement
Second statement
Third statement
%EXTRA
Extra wrong statement
Another Extra wrong statement
%END

There are also radio buttons with only a linebreak;
%BR
%RADIO
Wrong 1 (some math \(x^2\))
Wrong 2
%CORRECT Correct
Wrong 3
%END

And another radio thing
%BR
%RADIO
True
%CORRECT False
%END

Here are radio buttons randomized except for the last option which always comes last.  And there's a whole paragraph break

%RADIO
%BEGINRANDOM
%CORRECT Choice A
Choice B
Choice C
%ENDRANDOM
None of these
%END

We can also have another proof surely, maybe without any wrong statements

%PROOF
Statement \(x \not= y\)
Another Statement
%END

And we can add a hint on the number of correct statements

%PROOFHINT
Statement \(x \not= y\)
Another Statement
%EXTRA
Wrong statement
%END
