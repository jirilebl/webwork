%SETUP $a = random(5,9,1);
Consider \(f \colon [0,1] \to \mathbb{R} \(f(x) := $a x^2 - 1 .\)

\(f(0)\) is
$BR
%RADIO
Positive
%CORRECT Negative
Zero
%END

\(f(1)\) is
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Positive
Negative
Zero
%END

Does Bolzano's intermediate value theorem apply?
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Yes
No
Maybe
%END

If it applies, which of the following follows from Bolzano's theorem:
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT The function has a root in \((0,1).\)
The function achieves a minimum and a maximum.
The function is bounded.
%END

If applying bisection method to finding a root of \(f,\) the first interval is \((0,1).\)

The second interval is
$BR
from
%NUMBER 0
to
%NUMBER 1/2

The third interval is
$BR
from
%NUMBER 1/4
to
%NUMBER 1/2
