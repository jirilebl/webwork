Let us study Lemma 3.3.1 (from the book [1]).  Answer the interspersed questions.

$BBOLD Lemma 3.3.1. $EBOLD
$BITALIC A continuous function \(f \colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}\) is bounded. $EITALIC

$BITALIC Q: What is the statement about the function \(f \colon [a,b] \to \mathbb{R} ?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT continuous implies bounded
bounded implies continuous
continuous if and only if bounded
%END

$BITALIC Proof: $EITALIC
Let us prove this claim by contrapositive.

$BITALIC Q: Contrapositive of the statment of the lemma means what? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT \(f\) not bounded implies \(f\) is not continuous.
\(f\) not bounded implies \(f\) is not a function.
\(f\) bounded implies \(f\) is continuous.
%END

Suppose \(f\) is not bounded.

$BITALIC Q: What do we need to prove now? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT That there is at least one point in \([a,b]\) where \(f\) is not continuous.
That \(f\) is bounded, hence contradiction.
That \(f\) is continuous at all points.
%END

Then for each
\(n \in \mathbb{N} ,\) there is an \(x_n \in [a,b],\) such that
\[
\lvert f(x_n) \rvert \geq n .
\]

$BITALIC Q: Why? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT Negation of the definition of bounded: For every \(B\) there is an \(x\) such that \(\lvert f(x) \rvert \geq B.\)
Because the domain of \(f\) is open.
Every bounded sequence must have an bounded subsequence.
%END

The sequence \($LB x_n $RB\) is bounded as \(a \leq x_n \leq b .\)

$BITALIC Q: Why? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT The sequence is in the interal \([a,b] .\)
We choose the sequence to be such.
The sequence is convergent.
%END

$BITALIC Q: Is the sequence \($LB x_n $RB\) necessarily convergent? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIO
Yes
%CORRECT No
%END

By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem,
there is a convergent subsequence \($LB x_{n_i} $RB.\)
Let \(x := \lim\, x_{n_i} .\)

$BITALIC Q: This limit is a ... $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT sequence limit as \(i\) goes to \(\infty .\)
sequence limit as \(n\) goes to \(\infty .\)
sequence limit as \(n_i\) goes to \(\infty .\)
function limit as \(x_{n_i}\) goes to \(x .\)
%END

Since \(a \leq x_{n_i} \leq b\) for all \(i,\) then \(a \leq x \leq b .\)
The sequence \($LB f(x_{n_i}) $RB\) is not bounded 
as 
\(\lvert f(x_{n_i}) \rvert \geq n_i \geq i .\)
Thus \(f\) is not continuous at \(x\) as
\[
f(x)
=
f\Bigl( \lim_{i\to\infty} x_{n_i} \Bigr) ,
\qquad \text{but} \qquad
\lim_{i\to\infty} f(x_{n_i}) \enspace \text{does not exist.}
\]

$BITALIC Q: Why does this imply that \(f\) is not continuous at \(x?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT Continuous functions preserve sequence limits.
Continuous functions are bounded.
Functions defined on sequences are continuous.
%END

QED

$BITALIC Q: Why do we need to find the subsequence? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT The original sequence \($LB x_n $RB\) might not be convergent.
To make the sequence bounded.
To make sure we find an nonconvergent sequence \($LB f(x_{n_i}) $RB .\)
Because we want to make the proof more complicated.
%END

$BITALIC Q: What did we actually conclude in the proof? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT There is at least one point of \([a,b]\) where the function is not continuous.
The function is discontinuous at all points.
The function is unbounded.
The function is bounded.
%END
