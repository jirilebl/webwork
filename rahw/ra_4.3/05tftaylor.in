The Taylor series
\(\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty
\frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}{(x-x_0)}^k\) of an infinitely differentiable function is
$BR
%RADIO
Always convergent.
%CORRECT Sometimes convergent, sometimes divergent, depends on the function.
Never convergent.
%END

Taylor's theorem with the Lagrange form of the remainder is a generalization of
which theorem to higher order derivatives:
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT Mean value theorem
Extreme value theorem
Intermediate value theorem
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem
Fundamental theorem of calculus
%END

True or false:
An \(n\)-times differentiable function has at least \(n-1\) continuous derivatives.
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT True
False
%END

True or false:
If the \(n\)th Taylor polynomial of a function \(f\) at \(x_0\) is the zero polynomial,
then \(f(x_0) = f'(x_0) = \cdots = f^{(n)}(x_0) = 0 .\)
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT True
False
