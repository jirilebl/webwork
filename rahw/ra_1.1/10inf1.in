%DESC Proof that if a lower bound is in the set, it is the greatest lower bound (inf) (similar to ex 1.1.5)
%HINC head.txt
Suppose \(S\) is an ordered set and \(A \subset S\) with lower bound
\(x\) which is such that \(x \in A.\)

Prove that \(x\) is the greatest lower bound.

%PROOFHINT
Suppose \(y \in S\) is a lower bound for \(A.\)
Then \(y \leq x,\) as \(y\) is a lower bound for \(A\) and \(x \in A.\)
So \(x\) is the greatest lower bound, as \(y\) was an arbitrary lower bound.
%EXTRA
Suppose \(x \in S\) is the greatest lower bound for \(A.\)
Suppose \(y \in S\) is an upper bound for \(A.\)
Suppose \(y \in A\) is a lower bound for \(A.\)
As \(x \leq y ,\) we have that \(x\) is the greatest lower bound.
Then \( y \in S .\)
