What are the hypotheses of the fixed point theorem / contraction mapping principle for a metric space \(X\) and a mapping \(f \colon X \to X\)?
%CHECKBOXES
\(X\) is complete.
\(X\) is nonempty.
\(f\) is a contraction.
%EXTRA
\(f\) is differentiable.
\(f\) is constant.
\(X\) is compact.
%END

Suppose there exist two distinct fixed points for \(f \colon X \to X,\)
can \(f\) be a contraction?
$BR
%RADIO
Yes
%CORRECT No
%END

True or false:
If \(X\) is compact, and \(f \colon X \to X \) is continuous,
then \(f\) must have a fixed point.
Hint: Think about a circle.
$BR
%RADIO
True
%CORRECT False
%END

True or false:
If \(f \colon {\mathbb{R}} \to {\mathbb{R}}\) is differentiable and
\(\lvert f'(x) \rvert \leq \frac{1}{2} ,\) then \(f\) must have a fixed point.
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT True
False
%END

True or false:
If \(f \colon {\mathbb{R}} \to {\mathbb{R}}\) is differentiable and
\(\lvert f'(x) \rvert \leq 1 ,\) then \(f\) must have a fixed point.
$BR
%RADIO
True
%CORRECT False
%END

True or false:
If \(F \colon I \times J \to {\mathbb{R}}\) is Lipschitz continuous,
that is, there is a \(K\) such that for all \(x,s \in I\)
and all \(y,t \in J\) we have
\(\lvert F(x,y)-F(s,t) \rvert \leq K \sqrt{(x-s)^2+(y-t)^2},\) then
\(F\) satisfies the hypotheses of 
Picard's theorem.
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT True
False
%END

True or false:
If \(F \colon I \times J \to {\mathbb{R}}\) is uniformly continuous,
then \(f\) satisfies the hypotheses of 
Picard's theorem.
$BR
%RADIO
True
%CORRECT False
%END
