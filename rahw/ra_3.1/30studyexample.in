%NOPARTIAL
Let us study Example 3.1.5 in the book [1].  Answer the interspersed questions.


Claim: Consider \(f \colon {\mathbb{R}} \to {\mathbb{R}}\) defined by \(f(x) := x^2 .\)  Then
for any \(c \in {\mathbb{R}}\)
\[
\lim_{x\to c} f(x) = \lim_{x\to c} x^2 = c^2 .
\]

$BITALIC Q: Is an arbitrary \(c\) a cluster point of the domain of \(f?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Yes
No
%END

$BITALIC Proof: $EITALIC Let \(c \in {\mathbb{R}}\) be fixed, and suppose \(\epsilon $GTS 0\) is given.

$BITALIC Q: Why are we taking a fixed \(c ?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT Because if we prove the claim for an arbitrary fixed \(c,\) it is true for all \(c.\)
Because the claim is true for only some \(c .\)
Because \(c\) depends on \(\epsilon .\)
Because we only need to prove the claim for small \(c .\)
%END

$BITALIC Q: Why are we taking an arbitrary \(\epsilon $GTS 0 ?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT Because we need to prove that the definition of the limit is satisfied for all \(\epsilon $GTS 0 .\)
Because we need to prove that the definition of the limit for some specific \(\epsilon $GTS 0 .\)
Because \( \epsilon \) depends on \(c .\)
Because the value of \(\epsilon\) is irrelevant in the proof.
%END

Write
\[
\newcommand{\abs}[1]{\left\lvert {#1} \right\rvert}
\delta := \min \left\lbrace 1 , \, \frac{\epsilon}{2\abs{c}+1} \right\rbrace .
\]

$BITALIC Q: Is \(\delta\) always positive? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Yes
No
%END

$BITALIC Q: Why are we allowed to define \(\delta?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT Because we only need to show existence of \( \delta \) given an \(\epsilon .\)
Because we chose an arbitrary \(\epsilon .\)
Because we can always define all the quantities to a convenient value.
%END

Take \(x \not= c\) such that \(\abs{x-c} $LTS \delta .\)
In particular, \(\abs{x-c} $LTS 1 .\)
By reverse triangle inequality, we get
\[
\abs{x}-\abs{c} \leq \abs{x-c} $LTS 1 .
\]
Adding \(2\abs{c}\) to both sides, we obtain
\(\abs{x} + \abs{c} $LTS 2\abs{c} + 1 .\)

$BITALIC Q: What did we really just obtain about \(\abs{x}?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT We found \(\abs{x} $LTS \abs{c}+1 .\)
We found \(\abs{c} $LTS \abs{x}+1 .\)
We found \(2\abs{x} $LTS 2\abs{c}+1 .\)
We found that \(\abs{x}\) is arbitrarily close to \(c.\)
%END

We compute
\[
\begin{split}
\abs{f(x) - c^2} &= \abs{x^2-c^2} \\
&= \abs{(x+c)(x-c)} \\
&= \abs{x+c}\abs{x-c} \\
&\leq (\abs{x}+\abs{c})\abs{x-c} \\
&$LTS (2\abs{c}+1)\abs{x-c} \\
&$LTS (2\abs{c}+1)\frac{\epsilon}{2\abs{c}+1} = \epsilon .
\end{split}
\]

QED

$BITALIC Q: Why did we not just define \(\delta := \frac{\epsilon}{\abs{x+c}}\) as that's what we need to bound? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT The \(\delta\) cannot depend on \(x,\) it can only depend on \(c\) and \(\epsilon .\)
We could be dividing by zero if \(x+c=0 .\)
We can't do that, but we could define \(\delta :=\frac{\epsilon}{\abs{x}+\abs{c}+1} .\)
The \(\delta\) cannot depend on \(c.\)
That would make the proof too simple.
