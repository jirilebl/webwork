%SETUP $n = random(2,6,1);
Consider \(f \colon {\mathbb{R}} \to {\mathbb{R}}\) given by \(f(x) := x^2.\)
What is the largest \(\delta\) that will make the definition of limit at the origin (\(x=0\)) work
for \(\epsilon = \frac{1}{$n} ?\)
$BR
\(\delta = {}\)
%NUMBER sqrt(1/$n)


Now what would be the largest \(\delta\) for the same \(\epsilon\) but now at \(x=1 ?\)
$BR
\(\delta = {}\)
%NUMBER sqrt(1+1/($n))-1
