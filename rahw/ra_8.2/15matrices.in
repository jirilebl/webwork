True or false:
Given finite-dimensional vector spaces \(X\) and \(Y,\)
a given matrix represents the same linear operator in \(L(X,Y)\)
regardless of the choice of basis.

%RADIO
True
%CORRECT False
%END

Yes or no:
Suppose that \(X\) and \(Y\) are 2-dimensional
vector spaces.  Given an invertible linear operator
\(A \in L(X,Y),\) can bases be chosen on \(X\) and \(Y\) such that
\(A\) is represented by the identity matrix
\(\left[ \begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix} \right]?\)

Suppose \(X\) is the space of polynomials of degree 3 or less (a 4-dimensional
vector space).  Let \(D\) be the derivative operator.  Given the basis
\($LB 1,t,t^2,t^3 $RB\) on \(X\) what is the matrix giving \(D?\)
