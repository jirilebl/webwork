%SETUP $a = random(2,9,1);
%SETUP $len = random(2,9,1);
%SETUP $b = $a+$len;
%SETUP $k = random(2,9,1);
%SETUP $v = random(1,9,1);
Suppose that \(f \colon [$a,$b] \to \mathbb{R}\) is Lipschitz with constant \(K=$k .\)
Suppose that \(f($a) = $v .\)
What can you say about \(f($b) ?\)

%NUMBER $v-($k*$len)
\(\qquad \leq f($b) \leq \qquad \)
%NUMBER $v+($k*$len)


Can these values be attained?  That is, is it possible to have one of the
inequalities be an equality?

%CORRECT Yes
No

If you didn't know the Lipschitz constant for \(f,\) can you say anything else
about \(f($b)\) besides it being a real number?

Yes
%CORRECT No
