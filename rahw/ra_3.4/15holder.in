%NOPARTIAL
Suppose \(f \colon [a,b] \to {\mathbb{R}}\) is such that
\( \lvert f(x)-f(y) \rvert \leq {\lvert x-y \rvert}^{1/2} . \)

Is \(f\) necessarily Lipschitz?  (Note that the function \(\sqrt{x},\) for example, satisfies this condition.)

Yes
%CORRECT No

Prove that \(f\) is uniformly continuous.

%PROOF
Let \(\epsilon > 0\) be given.
Let \(\delta := \epsilon^2 .\)
Suppose \(x,y \in [a,b]\) are such that \(\lvert x-y\rvert < \delta . \)
Estimate, \( \lvert f(x)-f(y) \rvert \leq {\lvert x-y \rvert}^{1/2} \)
\( \qquad < {\delta}^{1/2} \)
\( \qquad = {(\epsilon^2)}^{1/2} = \epsilon \)
%EXTRA
Let \(\delta > 0 \) be given.
Let \(\delta := \epsilon^{1/2} .\)
Suppose \(x,y \in [a,b]\) are such that \({\lvert x-y\rvert}^{1/2} < \delta . \)
Suppose \(x,y \in [a,b]\) are such that \(\lvert f(x)-f(y)\rvert < \epsilon . \)
Estimate, \( \lvert x-y \rvert < \delta \)
\( \qquad < \epsilon^2 \)
\( \qquad = \delta \)
\( \qquad = \epsilon^2 \)

$BBOLD Remark: $EBOLD $BITALIC Such a function is said to be Hoelder continuous: That is,
\(f \colon S \to \mathbb{R}\) is Hoelder if there are positive \(C\) and \(\alpha\)
such that
\( \lvert f(x)-f(y) \rvert \leq C {\lvert x-y \rvert}^{\alpha} \) for all \(x,y \in S .\)  $EITALIC
