True or false:
If \(I,J \subset {\mathbb{R}}\) are intervals and \(f \colon I \to J\)
is a differentiable surjective (onto) function such that \(f'(x) $GTS 0\)

True or false:
If \(I,J \subset {\mathbb{R}}\) are intervals and \(f \colon I \to J\)
and \(g \colon J \to I\) are differentiable functions that are inverses
of each other.
If \(g'(y) $GTS 0 \) for all \(y \in J,\)
then \(f'(x) $GTS 0 \) for all \(x \in I.\)
