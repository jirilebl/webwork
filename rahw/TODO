* Short term goal: at least 3 problems per section for most sections except
  perhaps very short ones, at least in volume I, but the more the better,
  should have more in longer sections
* Short term TODO by section, Vol I:
  * 1.4: only two problems, perhaps need one more
  * 1.5: only two problems, perhaps need one more
  * 2.6: only two problems, need at least one or two more
  * 3.5: only two problems, both multiple choice, need at least one more
  * 3.6: only one (T/F) problem, need at least one more
  * 4.3: only two problems, perhaps need one more
  * 4.4: only one (T/F) problem, need at least one more
  * 5.4: only one problem, need some more 
  * 5.5: only one problem, need some more 
  * 6.2: only two problems, perhaps need one more
  * 6.3: only two problems, perhaps need one more
  * 7.3: only two problems, perhaps need one more
  * 7.5: only two problems, perhaps need one more
  * 7.6: only two problems, perhaps need one more

* Vol II: goal is something 2-3 problems per section, perhaps more for
  longer ones ("none" means no problems in the section yet):
  * 8.3: need some more perhaps
  * 8.6: need one more
  * 9.1: The counterexample problem kind of sucks, perhaps replace
  * 9.2: none
  * 9.3: none
  * 10.1: this needs more than 2, some more computation to test understanding of notation.
  * 10.2: need one more at least
  * 10.3: need one more
  * 10.5: need one more?
  * 10.6: none
  * 10.7: none
  * 11.1: none
  * 11.2: none
  * 11.3: none
  * 11.4: none
  * 11.5: none
  * 11.6: none
  * 11.7: none
  * 11.8: none
