True or false:
If \(f \colon {\mathbb{R}}^2 \to {\mathbb{R}}\) is a function
such that \(x \mapsto f(x,y)\) is continuous for every \(y\)
and

then \(f\) is continuous.

Suppose \(f \colon X \to Y\) is a continuous function between metric spaces.  Suppose we modify the metric on both \(X\) and \(Y\)
in such a way that the topology (the set of open sets) is unchanged.  Then \(f,\) with respect to the new metrics, is:
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Continuous.
Discontinuous.
Depends on the metric.
%END

Suppose \(f \colon X \to Y\) is an arbitrary function between metric space and the metric on \(X\) is
the discrete metric.  Then \(f\) is:
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Continuous.
Discontinuous.
Depends on the function.
