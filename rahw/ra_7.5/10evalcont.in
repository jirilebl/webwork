Let \(C([0,1],{\mathbb{R}})\) be our metric space with the uniform norm
metric:
\[
d(f,g) := \sup_{x \in [0,1]} \lvert f(x)-g(x) \rvert .
\]

Given any fixed \(p \in [0,1]\) show that the point evaluation map
\(E_p \colon C([0,1],{\mathbb{R}}) \to {\mathbb{R}}\) defined by
\(E_p(f) := f(p)\) is continuous.

%PROOF
Consider \(f,g \in C([0,1],{\mathbb{R}}) . \)
Estimate: \(\lvert E_p(f)-E_p(g) \rvert = \lvert f(p)-g(p) \rvert \)
\( \quad \leq \sup_{x \in [0,1]} \lvert f(x)-g(x) \rvert = d(f,g) . \)
So given any \(\epsilon $GTS 0, \) let \(\delta := \epsilon .\)
Now if \(d(f,g) $LTS \delta = \epsilon ,\) then \( \lvert E_p(f)-E_p(g) \rvert $LTS \epsilon . \)
%EXTRA
Let \(\delta := 0.\)
Suppose \(f=g .\)
\( \quad \geq \sup_{x \in [0,1]} \lvert f(x)-g(x) \rvert = d(f,g) . \)

Note that we seemingly didn't use the fact that \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous.
The issue is that without some hypotheses, the set of all real-valued functions
on \([0,1]\) is not a metric space using the metric given.  Why?

%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT For arbitrary functions \(\lvert f(x)-g(x) \rvert\) could be unbounded.
It makes no sense to talk about continuity of \(E_p\) with discontinuous functions.
Actually, the set of all real-valued functions on \([0,1]\) is a metric space.
%END

What larger set of functions (larger than the set of continuous functions) we
could use in the above proof without changing anything and still get a
continuous map between metric spaces:

%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT The set of bounded functions on \([0,1].\)
The set of all real-valued functions on \([0,1].\)
The set of all Riemann integrable functions on \([0,1].\)
The set of all differentiable functions on \([0,1].\)
The set of constant functions.
