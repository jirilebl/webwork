%FORMULAVARS n,DNE
Consider the series
\(\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n ,\) where
the partial sum is
\(\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^k x_n = \frac{k}{k+1} .\)

Find
%BR
\(x_n = {}\)
%FORMULA n/(n+1)-(n-1)/n

Does the series converge?
%BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Yes
No
%END

What does the series converge to if it converges (write "DNE" if it doesn't)?
%BR
%NUMBER 1

What is the reason?
%BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT The expression for the partial sums converges.
The series is a \(p\)-series with \(p=1 .\)
The series is like a harmonic series.
The expression for the partial sums diverges.
The numerator for each term in the series is 1.
The series is not Cauchy.
The terms of the series go to 0.
