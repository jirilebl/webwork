Let us study Rolle's theorem and its proof (from the book [1]).  Answer the interspersed questions.

$BBOLD Theorem $EBOLD (Rolle) .
$BITALIC
Let \(f \colon [a,b] \to {\mathbb{R}}\) be continuous function
differentiable on \((a,b)\) such that \(f(a) = f(b).\)
Then there exists a \(c \in (a,b)\) such that \(f'(c) = 0 .\)
$EITALIC

$BITALIC Q: Would the theorem be true if \(f\) was instead of continuous simply assumed
to be differentiable on \([a,b] ?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Yes
No
%END

$BITALIC Q: If \(g \colon {\mathbb{R}} \to {\mathbb{R}} \) is differentiable and \(g'(x) \not= 0\) for all \(x \in {\mathbb{R}} ,\)
what does Rolle's theorem immediately imply about \(g ?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
Nothing.
%CORRECT That \(g\) is one-to-one.
That \(g\) is onto.
That \(g\) is increasing.
%END

$BITALIC Proof: $EITALIC
As \(f\) is continuous on \([a,b],\) it attains
an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum in \([a,b].\)

$BITALIC Q: Is it possible that the maximum occurs at \(a\) or \(b ?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Yes
No
%END

We wish to apply Lemma 4.2.2, and so we need to find
some \(c \in (a,b)\) where \(f\) attains a minimum or a maximum.

$BITALIC Q: Is it possible that there is no minimum in \((a,b) ?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Yes
No
%END

$BITALIC Q: Is it possible that there is no maximum in \((a,b) ?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Yes
No
%END

Write \(K := f(a) = f(b).\)
If there exists an \(x\) such that \(f(x) $GTS K,\) then the absolute
maximum is bigger than \(K\) and hence occurs at some \(c \in (a,b),\) and
therefore \(f'(c) = 0.\)

$BITALIC Q: Why did we conclude that the maximum is bigger than \(K ?\) $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT Because \( \max_{s \in [a,b]} f(s) \geq f(x) $GTS K . \)
Because \(x \in [a,b] .\)
Because \(K = f(a) = f(b) . \)
Because \(K\) is the minimum of \(f(x) .\)
%END

On the other hand, if there exists an \(x\)
such that \(f(x) $LTS K,\) then the absolute minimum occurs at some
\(c \in (a,b),\) and so \(f'(c) = 0.\)

$BITALIC Q: Could both of the cases above (an \(x\) exists in both cases) occur at once? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIO
%CORRECT Yes
No
%END

$BITALIC Q: What case is left over? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT There is no \(x\) such that \(f(x) \not= K .\)
We handled all the cases already.
When \(f\) is strictly increasing.
When \(f'(x) = K\) is strictly increasing.
There is some \(x\) such that \(f(x) = K .\)
%END

If there is no \(x\) such that
\(f(x) $GTS K\) or
\(f(x) $LTS K,\) then \(f(x) = K\) for all \(x\) and then
\(f'(x) = 0\) for all \(x \in [a,b],\) so any \(c \in (a,b)\) works.
QED.

$BITALIC Q: If \(f\) is constant, does it have absolute minima and maxima? $EITALIC
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
No
%CORRECT Every point is an absolute maximum and a minimum.
Absolute maxima and minima are not defined for constant functions.
No, but it has relative absolute minima and maxima.
