Let \(\displaystyle h(x,y) := \frac{xy}{x^2+y^2} \) for \((x,y)\not=0\) and \(h(0,0)=0 .\)
Let \(\displaystyle g(y) := \int_0^1 h(x,y) \, dx . \)

Note that \(\displaystyle \frac{\partial h}{\partial y}\) exists for all \((x,y)\)
including at the origin.

Is \(g(y)\) defined for all \(y \in {\mathbb{R}}\)?

No

For \((x,y)\not=(0,0),\) compute
\(\displaystyle
\frac{\partial h}{\partial y}(x,y)={}\)
%FORMULA (x*(x^2-y^2))/((x^2+y^2)^2)

For \((x,y)=(0,0),\) compute
\(\displaystyle
\frac{\partial h}{\partial y}(0,0)={}\)
%NUMBER 0

For \(y\not= 0,\) compute (don't be afraid of some calculus)
\(\displaystyle
g'(y) = {}\)
%FORMULA (y^2)/(1+y^2)+(1/2)*ln(1+y^2)-1-(1/2)*ln(y^2)

Does the limit of \(g'(y)\) as \(y \to 0\) exist?
$BR
%RADIO
Yes
%CORRECT No
%END

For \(x $GTS 0,\) compute
\(\displaystyle \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} (x,0) = {}  \)
%FORMULA 1/x

Does
\(\displaystyle \int_0^1 \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} (x,0) \, dx \) exist?
$BR
%RADIO
Yes
%CORRECT No
%END

Why can't we apply the Liebniz rule (differentiate under the integral)
at \(y=0\)?
$BR
%RADIORANDOM
%CORRECT \(\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial y}\) is not continuous.
\(\dfrac{\partial h}{\partial y}\) does not exist.
In fact, we could apply Liebniz rule at \(y=0.\)
\(h\) is not defined at the origin.
\(h\) is unbounded.
