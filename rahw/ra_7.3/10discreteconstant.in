Prove that in a metric space \((X,d)\) where \(d\) is the discrete metric, a sequence is convergent if and only if
some \(K\)-tail is constant.

First prove that a convergent sequence is eventually constant:

%PROOF
Suppose \($LB x_n $RB\) is a convergent sequence in \((X,d),\) converging to \(x \in X.\)
There exists an \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N,\) we have \(d(x_n,x) $LTS 1 .\)
As \(d\) is the discrete metric, \(d(x_n,x) $LTS 1\) implies \(d(x_n,x) = 0,\)
and so \(x_n = x\) for all \(n \geq N.\)
%EXTRA
and so \(x_n = 0\) for all \(n \geq N.\)
and so \(x_n = x\) for all \(n \in {\mathbb{N}}.\)
There exists an \(N\) such that for all \(n \leq N,\) we have \(d(x_n,x) $LTS 1 .\)
Suppose \($LB x_n $RB\) is a divergent sequence in \((X,d).\)
%END

Now prove that every eventually convergent sequence is convergent.

%PROOF
Suppose \($LB x_n $RB\) is a sequence, \(N\) a number, and \(x \in X\) such that \(x_n=x\) for all \(n \geq N ,\)
and let \(\epsilon $GTS 0 \) be given.
Then for all \(n \geq N\) we have
\(d(x_n,x) = 0 $LTS \epsilon .\)
Thus \($LB x_n $RB\) converges to \(x.\)
%EXTRA
Suppose \($LB x_n $RB\) is a convergent sequence,
and let \(\epsilon := 1 .\)
\(d(x_n,x) = \epsilon .\)
\(d(x_n,x) = 1 .\)
Thus \($LB x_n $RB\) diverges.
