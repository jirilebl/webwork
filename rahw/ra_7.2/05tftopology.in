In the following, \((X,d)\) is a metric space.  Note that we follow the convention that when we say open or closed ball,
we mean that the radius is always positive.

True or false:
Suppose \(A \subset B \subset X.\)
Then \(A\) is open in the subspace topology of \(B\) if and only if it is open in the topology of \(X.\)

True or false:
Suppose \(A \subset B \subset X\) and \(B\) is open (in \(X\)).
